# Getting started

### Setting up golang (go)
Golang forms the heart of this whole project, and it is recommended to have basic understanding of how the language works.
To begin with, you'll need to setup and install golang with an IDE on local. We recommend you to have the following running:
* [Latest version](https://golang.org/dl) of Golang 
* [Goland IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) - If you are a student, this might be free with a college email account
* Alternate IDE - Visual studio code
  * IDE installation - [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
  * Go specific setup - [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/go)
  * In case auto-import doesn't work - [here](https://medium.com/backend-habit/setting-golang-plugin-on-vscode-for-autocomplete-and-auto-import-30bf5c58138a)
 
### Go tutorial  
We recommend using [this tutorial by freecodecamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS4e4q9oBaU&t=807s) for getting started with golang.

### Code Templating
Code templating (writing code that writes code) forms the heart of the project. Every language has certain mechanisms to provide templating functionalities, and we heavily make use of Go's code templating to provide features.
Please follow this amazing [Medium article written by Satish Manohar](https://medium.com/@IndianGuru/understanding-go-s-template-package-c5307758fab0) which highlights how we can make use of templating to write anything (including go itself).

### Programming Fundamentals
many of the fundamentals which go follows are derived from certain industry standards which aren't specific to go, but should be followed in the industry regardless.

#### How to write production ready code - [Link](https://dev.to/bolt04/what-is-production-ready-code-3dip)
A quick read for for anyone starting to work on writing production level code for the first time.
#### Highly recommended - [Go proverbs](http://go-proverbs.github.io)
These proverbs form the highlights why there was a need for a new programming language in the first place. **Go** is a first class language written to write complex logics in a simplistic way. It is able to run millions of go-routines on systems which max out with thousands of java threads. 
The proverbs highlight the knowledge base of Google and Rob Pike, and what they realised while developing the language. Understanding these will be extremely helpful in improving coding style, and understanding why we do what we do for creating scalable production systems.

#### Solid principles - [Link](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual_articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design)
It goes without saying that to write any effective industry-standard code, we must be able to understand and learn certain principles which help us take better decisions regarding "what goes where" as far as programs as concerned. SOLID principles go a long way in getting the best out of a software engineer, but these concepts on a high level should give a great understanding in learning about how code must be structured and designed.

#### Practical Go (optional) - [Detailed version](https://dave.cheney.net/practical-go/presentations/qcon-china.html)
These proverbs are execrpts from the qcon-china presentation, where people discussed on the ways people write golang.
